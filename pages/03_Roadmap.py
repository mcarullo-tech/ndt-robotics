    ### Stage 1: Precision Impactor (6 months, $100K)
    
    **What:** Automated impact system replacing manual hammer  
    **Impact:** +20% capacity, validates market demand  
    **ROI:** Payback in 12-18 months  
    
    ---
    
    ### Stage 2: Full Robotic Platform (12-18 months, $300K)
    
    **What:** Industrial robotic arm + AU-E integration + AI software  
    **Impact:** +150% capacity, premium positioning, $3.7M annual EBITDA  
    **ROI:** 4:1 return within 3 years  
    
    ---
    
    ### Why Two Stages?
    
    1. Stage 1 can be deployed quickly for immediate benefits
    2. Stage 1 cash partially funds Stage 2
    3. Proven technologies—not R&D risk
    4. Demonstrate progress to stakeholders
